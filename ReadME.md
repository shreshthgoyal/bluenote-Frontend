## Backend Features

### **Routes**
---
  - **User Routes**
     - Register : To register the User
     - Login    : To sign in the User
    
   - **Events**
     - Getall : Get all notes by the User.
     - Create : To create a note for the User.
     - Update : To update a note by the User.
     - Delete : To delete a particular note by the User.

### **Security**
---
- SQL Injection
  - User is logged in to site through E-mail Verification system.
  - We used parameterized queries and input validation to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
- User Authentication
  - We added Password Validation for users to enter strong passwords.
  - Passwords are not stored as plain-texts they are hashed and salted then stored in the database.
  - No critical information like the password of the user is sent into the session.
 - Cross-Site Scripting Attacks
   - We enabled CORS to permit loading of resources from other sites.
   - We enabled Helmet in our backend which prevents our website from XSS attacks upto some extent.
   - Helmet provieds our site with Content-Security-Policy (CSP) which also prevents XSS attacks.

> I enabled compression middleware to compress response bodies for all request that traverse through the middleware.
